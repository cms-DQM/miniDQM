# Plot requests and explanations about them


All these plots cannot give proper DQM GUI url that can be parametrized using run number and dataset name. You can easily understand what I mean either unshortened version of below tinyurls or DQM Offline versions of them. Specifically for "Jets", it was not possible to find them in any `/eos/cms/store/group/comm_dqm/DQMGUI_data/Run2023/JetMET*` root files.
